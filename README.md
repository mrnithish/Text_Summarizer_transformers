# Text Summarization with Transformers Pipeline

This Python project is designed for text summarization using the Transformers pipeline. It leverages Hugging Face's Transformers library to provide an easy-to-use interface for summarizing text content.

## Features

- **Text Summarization**: The script can generate concise summaries of long text content.
- **Customizable Summarization Length**: Users can specify the desired length of the summary.
- **Multiple Languages**: The Transformers pipeline supports multiple languages, making it versatile for various text sources.
- **Easy Integration**: This project provides a straightforward interface for integrating Transformers' powerful text summarization capabilities into your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Hugging Face Transformers library

You can install the Transformers library using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-summarization-transformers.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd text-summarization-transformers
```

3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python summarize_text.py
```

4. The script will prompt you to input the text you want to summarize and the desired summary length.

5. The summarized text will be displayed in the console.

## Customization

You can customize the script to handle specific languages, summarization models, or text preprocessing by modifying the `summarize_text.py` script.
